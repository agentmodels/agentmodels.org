[x] use cdn version of viz and editor (if exists)
[-] set up version of agentmodels that auto-recompiles when agents code changes
    cd /assets/js/
    ln ~/Projects/agentmodels.org/node_modules/webppl/bundle/webppl.js webppl.link.js
    cd ../../node_modules/webppl
    grunt browserify-watch:../webppl-timeit:../webppl-dp:../webppl-agents
    - not really working
[x] let's try the version where I manually recompile
     ./scripts/update-webppl-local
[ ] go through chapters, make srue code runs with latest webppl
    [ ] rename erp to dist
    [ ] change Enumerate to Infer syntax
    [ ] change Rejection to Infer syntax
[ ] update code in webppl-agents
[ ] think about additional refactoring
