[x] use cdn version of viz and editor (if exists)
[-] set up version of agentmodels that auto-recompiles when agents code changes
    cd /assets/js/
    ln ~/Projects/agentmodels.org/node_modules/webppl/bundle/webppl.js webppl.link.js
    cd ../../node_modules/webppl
    grunt browserify-watch:../webppl-timeit:../webppl-dp:../webppl-agents
    - not really working
[x] let's try the version where I manually recompile
     ./scripts/update-webppl-local

[ ] go through chapters, make srue code runs with latest webppl
    per chapter:
      [ ] rename erp to dist
      [ ] change Enumerate to Infer syntax
      [ ] change Rejection to Infer syntax
      [ ] categoricalERP
      [ ] deltaERP
    - in chapter 3c now - this makes use of makeBandit in webppl-agents, which needs to be upgraded.
      [ ] update code in webppl-agents
          [ ] probably can't use .sample check to identify ERPs      
          [ ] rename erp to dist
          [x] score doesn't take parameters anymore
          [x] change Enumerate to Infer syntax
          [x] change Rejection to Infer syntax
          [x] categoricalERP
          [x] deltaERP      
      [ ] run tests to verify that everything works
          - not working right now with current webppl

[ ] think about additional refactoring
