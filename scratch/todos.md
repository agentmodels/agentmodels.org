# Todos


## Visuals
- Would be good to be able to have a button that runs code repeatedly (in cases where outcome is stochastic). For instance, you hit the button and you see repeated samples of the gridworld trajectory for the same agent. 


## Existing chapters

### III.1
- Replace the Gridworld examples with newGridworld
- agent -> act, and we should probably get rid of timeLeft and put that into the state (for consistency with later versions). get rid of totalTime (just use timeLeft). Have 'terminateAfterAction' as part of the state. 


### III.2
- Use newGridworld for hike example.
- Update agent mode here to be consistent with later on. (Same changes as above). 
- Need to make expectedUtilities work.
