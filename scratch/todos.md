## TODOs


### Smaller things

- revise webppl-agents chapter

- RL chapter: policy gradient, PSRL (more examples), bayesian q-learning.

- learning about agents: explain how RL fits in.

- use only regular bandits (modify the current bandits)

- add better diagrams (e.g. for POMDP) and some photos/graphs (to have more visual content overall). 

### Bigger projects

- speed up forward models. consider MCTS (can you do this in a functionally pure way?), and Q-learning and policy gradient. Also interesting caching schemes. 

- speed up and explore approximate inference for IRL. Bayesian IRL techniques. What about Bayesian model-free IRL?

- RL as a model of human planning (hasn't been explored much).
