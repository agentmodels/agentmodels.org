title: Bounded Agents â€” Myopia for rewards and updates
description: Fast approximate planning algorithms that assume a short time horizon for utilities (reward-myopic) or for belief updates (update-myopic). 

---

### Introduction
The previous chapter extended the MDP agent model to include exponential and hyperbolic discounting. The goal was to produce models of human behavior that capture a prominent *bias* (time inconsistency). As noted [earlier](/chapters/5-biases-intro) humans are not just biased but also *cognitively bounded*. This chapter extends the POMDP agent model with sub-optimal but frugal planning algorithms. These algorithms are implemented by adding a few lines of code to our POMDP agent. We illustrate their limitations and also cases where their performance is close to optimal (and much quicker). 


## Reward-myopic Planning: the basic idea
One reason optimal planning is computationally difficult is that it chooses actions in a way that takes into account the entire future. The optimal (PO)MDP agent reasons backwards from the utility of its final state. It considers actions on earlier timesteps based on whether they lead to good final states. (With an infinite time horizon, an optimal agent must consider the expected utility of being in every possible state, including states only reachable after a very long duration). Suppose we used this approach when playing against a predictable chess algorithm for a fixed and very large number of timesteps. Then it would simulate every possible chess game up to that duration, including many games that are incredibly unlikely.

Instead of explicitly optimizing for the entire future when taking an action, an agent can "myopically" optimize for near-term rewards. With a time-horizon of 1000 timesteps, the agent would take action $$a_1$$ optimizing for reward up to (say) timestep $$t_{10}$$, action $$a_2$$ optimizing for reward up to $$t_{11}$$, and so on. Whereas the optimal agent computes a complete plan or *policy* at the first timestep and thereafter simply executes the policy, the "Reward-myopic agent" computes a new (near-term) policy for each timestep. So the Reward-myopic agent spreads out their computation over the whole time-horizon. If optimal planning is super-linear in the time-horizon, the Reward-myopic agent will do less computation overall[^reward].

[^reward]: The Reward-myopic agent only considers states or belief-states that it actually enters or that it gets close to, while the Optimal approach considers every possible state or belief-state.

The Reward-myopic approach works best if continually optimizing for the short-term produces good results in the long-term. It's easy to imagine probems where this doesn't hold: e.g. if there's a big prize at the end of a long corridor (with no rewards along the way). A remedy is to find a proxy for the long-term expected utility of being in a state that is cheap to compute. For example, you can myopically optimize the score of future chess positions using a cheaply computed evaluation function. In this chapter, we only consider the simplest kind of Reward-myopic planning, where the agent optimizes for short-term utility rather than a proxy of long-term utility.


### Reward-myopic Planning: implementation and examples
The **Reward-myopic agent** takes the action that would be optimal if the time-horizon were $$C_g$$ steps into the future. The "cutoff" or "bound", $$C_g > 0$$, will typically be much smaller than the time horizon for the decision problem.

You will notice the similarity between the Reward-myopic agent and the hyperbolic discounting agents. Both agents make plans based (mostly) on short-term rewards. Both agents revise these plans at every timestep. And the Naive and Reward-myopic agents both have implicit models of their future selves that are incorrect. A major difference is that Reward-myopic planning is much easier to make computationally fast. Given their similarity, it is unsurprising that we implement the Reward-myopic agent using the concept of *delay* described in the previous chapter. The formalization and implementation of the Reward-myopic agent is left as an exercise.

>**Exercise:** Formalize POMDP and MDP versions of the Reward-myopic agent by modifiying the equations for the expected utility of state-action pairs or belief-state-action pairs. Implement the agent by modifying the code for the POMDP and MDP agents. Verify that the agent behaves sub-optimally (but more efficiently) on Gridworld and Bandit problems. 

------

The Reward-myopic agent will do well if good short-term actions produce good long-term consequences. In Bandit problems, elaborate long-terms plans are not needed to reach particular desirable future states. It turns out that a maximally Reward-myopic agent, who only cares about the immediate reward ($$C_g = 1$$), does well on the standard Multi-arm bandit problem -- provided that it has some noise in its actions TODO add sutton barto cite refp:sutton119xreinforcement.

The next codeboxes show the performance of the Reward-myopic agent on Bandit problems. The first codebox is a two-arm Bandit problem, illustrated in Figure 1. We use a Reward-myopic agent with high softmax noise: $$C_g=1$$ and $$\alpha=10$$. The Reward-myopic agent's average reward over 100 trials is close to the expected average reward given perfect knowledge of the arms.

## Myopic Updating: the basic idea

In Chapter 3.3, we noted that solving a finite-horizon Multi-arm bandit problem is intractable in the number of arms and trials. So bounded agents will use a sub-optimal but tractable algorithm for this problem. In this chapter we describe and implement a widely-studied approach to Bandits (and POMDPs generally) that is sub-optimal but which can be very effective in practice. We refer to the approach as *Myopic Updating*, because it is "myopic" or "greedy" with respect to exploration. The idea is that the agent at time $$t_0$$ assumes he can only *explore* (i.e. update beliefs from observations) up to some cutoff point $$C_m$$ steps into the future. After that point he just *exploits* (i.e. he gain rewards but doesn't update from the rewards he observes). In reality, the agent will continue to update beliefs after time $$t_0+C_m$$. The Update-myopic agent, like the Naive hyperbolic discounter, has an incorrect model of his future self. We call an agent that uses Myopic Updating an "Update-myopic Agent". This will be precisely defined below. 

Myopic Updating is an efficient way to solve Bandit problems, yielding an optimal solution in the two-arm case refp:frazier2008knowledge, and also provides a good fit to human performance in Bandit problems refp:zhang2013forgetful. In what follows, we describe Myopic Updating in more detail, explain how to incorporate it into out POMDP agent model, and then exhibit its performance on Bandit problems.

### Myopic Updating: applications and limitations

As noted above, Myopic Updating has been studied in Machine Learning refp:gonzalez2015glasses and Operations Research refp:ryzhov2012knowledge as part of algorithms for generalized Bandit problems. In most cases, the cutoff point $$C_m$$ after which the agent assumes himself to exploit is set to $$C_m=1$$. This results in a scalable, analytically tractable optimization problem: pull the arm that maximizes the expected value of future exploitation given you pulled that arm. This "future exploitation" means that you pick the arm that is best in expectation for the rest of time.

We've presented Bandit problems with a finite number of arms, and with discrete rewards that are uncorrelated across arms. Myopic Updating works well in this setting but also works for generalized Bandit Problems: e.g. when rewards are correlated, when rewards are continuous, and in the "Bayesian Optimization" setting where instead of a fixed number of arms the goal is to optimize high-dimensional real-valued function refp:ryzhov2012knowledge. 

Myopic Updating does not work well for POMDPs in general. Suppose you are looking for a good restaurant in a foreign city. A good strategy is to walk to a busy street and then find the busiest restaurant. If reaching the busy street takes longer than the myopic cutoff $$C_m$$, then an Update-myopic agent won't see value in this plan. We present a concrete example of this problem below ("Restaurant Search"). This example highlights a way in which Bandit problems are an especially simple POMDP. In a Bandit problem, every aspect of the unknown latent state can be queried at any timestep (by pulling the appropriate arm). So even the Myopic Agent with $$C_m=1$$ is sensitive to the information value of every possible observation that the POMDP can yield[^selfmodel].

[^selfmodel]: The Update-myopic agent incorrectly models his future self, by assuming it ceases to update after cutoff point $$C_m$$. This incorrect "self-modeling" is also a property of model-free RL agents. For example, a Q-learner's estimation of expected utilities for states ignores the fact that the Q-learner will randomly explore with some probability. SARSA, on the other hand, does take its random exploration into account when computing this estimate. But it doesn't model the way in which its future exploration behavior will make certain actions useful in the present (as in the example of finding a restaurant in a foreign city).

### Myopic Updating: formal model
Myopic Updating only makes sense in the context of an agent that is capable of learning from observations (i.e. in the POMDP rather than MDP setting). So our goal is to generalize our agent model for solving POMDPs to a Myopic Updating with $$C_m \in [1,\infty]$$.

**Exercise:** Before reading on, modify the equations defining the [POMDP agent](/chapters/3c-pomdp) in order to generalize the agent model to include Myopic Updating. The optimal POMDP agent will be the special case when $$C_m=\infty$$.

------------

To extend the POMDP agent to the Update-myopic agent, we use the idea of *delays* from the previous chapter. These delays are not used to evaluate future rewards (as any discounting agent would use them). They are used to determine how future actions are simulated. If the future action occurs when delay $$d$$ exceeds cutoff point $$C_m$$, then the simulated future self does not do a belief update before taking the action. (This makes the Update-myopic agent analogous to the Naive agent: both simulate the future action by projecting the wrong delay value onto their future self). 

We retain the notation from the definition of the POMDP agent and skip directly to the equation for the expected utility of a state, which we modify for the Update-myopic agent with cutoff point $$C_m \in [1,\infty]$$:

$$
EU_{b}[s,a,d] = U(s,a) + \mathbb{E}_{s',o,a'}(EU_{b'}[s',a'_{b'},d+1])
$$

where:

- $$s' \sim T(s,a)$$ and $$o \sim O(s',a)$$

- $$a'_{b'}$$ is the softmax action the agent takes given new belief $$b'$$

- the new belief state $$b'$$ is defined as:

$$
b'(s') \propto I_{C_m}(s',a,o,d)\sum_{s \in S}{T(s,a,s')b(s)}
$$

<!-- problem with < sign in latex math-->
where $$I_{C_m}(s',a,o,d) = O(s',a,o)$$ if $$d$$ < $$C_m$$ and $$I_{C_m}(s',a,o,d) = 1$$ otherwise.

The key part is the definition of $$b'$$. The Update-myopic agent assumes his future self updates only on his last action $$a$$ and not on observation $$o$$. So the future self will know about state changes that follow a priori from his actions. (In a deterministic Gridworld, the future self would know his new location and that the time remaining had been counted down).

The implementation of the Update-myopic agent in WebPPL is a direct translation of the definition provided above.

>**Exercise:** Modify the code for the POMDP agent to represent an Update-myopic agent. See this <a href="/chapters/3c-pomdp.html#pomdpCode">codebox</a> or this library [script](https://github.com/agentmodels/webppl-agents/blob/master/src/agents/makePOMDPAgent.wppl).


### Myopic Updating for Bandits

The Update-myopic agent performs well on a variety of Bandit problems. The following codeboxes compare the Update-myopic agent to the Optimal POMDP agent on binary, two-arm Bandits (see the specific example in Figure 3). TODO: add statement about equivalent performance. 

<img src="/assets/img/5b-myopic-bandit.png" alt="diagram" style="width: 600px;"/>

>**Figure 3**: Bandit problem. The agent's prior includes two hypotheses for the rewards of each arm, with the prior probability of each labeled to the left and right of the boxes. The priors on each arm are independent and so there are four hypotheses overall. Boxes with actual rewards have a bold border.

### Myopic Updating for the Restaurant Search Problem

The limitations of Myopic Updating are straightforward. The Update-myopic agent assumes they will not update beliefs after the bound at $$C_m$$. As a result, they won't make plans that involve learning something after the bound.

We illustrate this limitation with a new problem:

>**Restaurant Search:** You are looking for a good restaurant in a foreign city without the aid of a smartphone. You know the quality of some restaurants already and you are uncertain about the others. If you walk right up to a restaurant, you can tell its quality by seeing how busy it is inside. You care about the quality of the restaurant (a scalar) and about minimizing the time spent walking.

How does the Update-myopic agent fail? Suppose that a few blocks from agent is a great restaurant next to a bad restaurant and the agent doesn't know which is which. If the agent checked inside each restaurant, they would pick out the great one. But if they are Update-myopic, they assume they'd be unable to tell between them.

The codebox below depicts a toy version of this problem in Gridworld. The restaurants vary in quality between 0 and 5. The agent knows the quality of Restaurant A and is unsure about the other restaurants. One of Restaurants D and E is great and the other is bad. The Optimal POMDP agent will go right up to each restaurant and find out which is great. The Update-myopic agent, with low enough bound $$C_m$$, will either go to the known good restaurant A or investigate one of restaurants that is closer than D and E.

<!--TODO: Extend the x-axis to make D and E further away. Consider how to make the myopic agent faster in this context. (Would also be nice to illustrate observations or the agent's belief state somehow).

TODO: gridworld draw should take pomdp trajectories. they should also take POMDP as "world".
